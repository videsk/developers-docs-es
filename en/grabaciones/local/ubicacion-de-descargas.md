# Download Location

Below, you can find instructions on how to configure the download folder for each browser.

## Google Chrome

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend creating a new profile for your agent to work in, so that other downloads don't get mixed up.
{% endhint %}

Access Google Chrome, then go to the top right of your screen and click on the three vertical dots. Then look for the "**Settings**" option, clicking it will open a new tab.

In the left sidebar, find "**Advanced Settings**", and then click on "**Downloads**".

You'll see two options, "**Location**" and "**Ask where to save each file before downloading**".

Click on the "**Location**" button and select the folder assigned to sync the recordings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that the "**Ask where to save each file before downloading**" box is unchecked, so that recordings are automatically downloaded without asking the agent.
{% endhint %}
