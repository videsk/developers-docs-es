**Our programming is mostly event-driven**. This is because almost all of Videsk is in real time, we require that actions be carried out through events and also provides full control of the behavior of the code.

Part of our base technology stack is:

| Technology | Use |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| HTTP (fetch) | Consumption of Rest API |
| Websockets | Realtime API |
| WebRTC | Video calls over browser and Webview |

In the side or top menu (hamburger menu) you can find the index of our documentation to move quickly. Also in the upper right side you will find the search engine where you can search by keywords.

**We're excited to see what you can do with Videsk!**&#x20;
