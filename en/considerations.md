# â€¼ Considerations

Read the following considerations before you start testing or integrating Videsk.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**You must close any type of program that may be using your microphone and/or camera before making a call.**

This is because it is not possible to use the microphone or camera simultaneously with your browser on any device, for example: Zoom, Skype, Teams, Bluejeans, Webex, Discord, Slack, Lifesize, GoToMeeting, etc. that are installed on your computer.

The exceptions are that you are using a video call within the same browser.

If you are in a demo with your team we suggest you turn off or mute your microphone and camera.
